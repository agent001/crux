= An Interactive Tale Of Time

For those readers whose learning ability is better when affections
are in place we're offering a short story writing experience
through database transactions and queries.

* Domain evolution
  // Imagine we acquired a new datasource telling us about the past. We feed it in.
  // Characters should get more complex motivations.

== Setup
Assuming you have some basic knowledge of Clojure and you own a REPL.
All you need for this tale is add Crux dep.

[source,clj]
----
include::./deps.edn[tags=CruxDep]
----


Charles is a shopkeeper who possesses a truly magical artefact:
A Rather Cozy Mug.
When Mary and her fellow pirates steal the mug, Charles recruits the
assistance of Joe, a rogue traveller, to help recover it.


Fire up a repl and create a namespace

include::./a_tale.clj[tags=a-tale/create-ns]

== Define a system

[source,clj]
----
include::./a_tale.clj[tags=a-tale/def-system]

== Letting data in
The year is 1740. We want to transact in our first character.


[source,clj]

include::./a_tale.clj[tags=a-tale/def-character]
----

Load the remaining part of the set

include::./a_tale.clj[tags=a-tale/rest-of-set]

== Looking Around : Basic Queries
Get a database _value_ and read from it consistently

[source,clj]
----
include::./a_tale.clj[tags=a-tale/simple-queries]
----


== Balancing the world (delete and evict)

Ok yes magic beans once _were_ in the realm, and we want to remember that,
but following advice from our publisher we've decided to remove them from
the story for now. Charles won't know that they ever existed!

[source,clj]
----
include::./a_tale.clj[tags=a-tale/delete-query]
----


Sometimes people enter data which just doesn't belong there or that they no
longer have a legal right to store (GDPR, I'm looking at you, dear).
Lets completely wipe all traces of that laptop from the timelines.

include::./a_tale.clj[tags=a-tale/evict-query]
----


Let's see what we got now
[source,clj]

include::./a_tale.clj[tags=a-tale/eviction-result]
----

== Some character development

Let's see how Crux handles references. Give our characters some artefacts

Note that transactions in Crux will rewrite the whole entity.
This is because the core of Crux is intentionally slim, and
features like partial updates shall be kept in the upcoming convinience projects!
